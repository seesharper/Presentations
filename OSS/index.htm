---

# Open source culture

## * Be nice to each other
## * Passion driven development
## * We are here to learn and contribute

---

# Continuous Integration

* ## Azure Pipelines (Linux, Mac and Windows)
* ## Dependabot
* ## Treat your build server as a "cron job"

# Documentation Driven Development

## TDD => Write Test -> Write Code

## DDD => Write Docs => Write Tests => Write Code

### Much easier to change code in Markdown

### If we have trouble explaining the API, probably not a good API ðŸ˜€
---

# Documentation

* ## README.md
* ## MKDocs (http://www.lightinject.net/)
---

# Human Resources

## Limited, typically one or a small group of people.
## Contributors are just there for the PR.
## Try to be at least two people
## Maintain only a single version
## Don't break anything.

---

---


# Release management

* ## Automate all things.
* ## Change logs
* ## Push packages
* ## Single click deployment.
* ## Master branch is always ready to go.

https://github.com/seesharper/LightInject.Microsoft.DependencyInjection/releases

---

# Source code management

* ## NEVER push directly to master
###(You will fuck up eventually)
* ## All changes must come as pull requests.
* ## Can we release from master now?

---


# Code Quality

## Everyone can review your code
## You don't want issues
## Good and clean code builds trust
## Code coverage - minimum 100% (no joke)

---

# The art of saying "No!"

* ## Don't add nice to have features
* ## Once you merge a pull request, you own the code.
* ## When saying no, be polite and explain why.
* ## If possible, try to come up with a workaround.

This is me saying no
