# C# Scripting


# Agenda

- The history of C# scripting
- The moving parts
- Use cases

---

# History

## * Goes back to 2004
## * CS Script/ScriptCs
## * Edited using your favorite text editor 
## * No intellisense or debugging 

---
# The main players

## * Roslyn
## * OmniSharp
## * IDE (VSCode, Sublime, Atom etc)
## * Runners (ScriptCs, CSI, Dotnet-Script, Cake)

---

# ScriptCs

## * Runs on full framework (Windows desktop or Mono)
## * Debugging (VSCode with runng on mono/ VS2017)
## * Has its own package management system 


---
# Repo's 

## [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn)
## [OmniSharp](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn)
## [ScriptCS](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs)
## [Dotnet-Script](https://github.com/filipw/dotnet-script)


---
# project.json (RIP)

## * The new and shiny project format
## * Dead before .Net Core made RTM
## * The magic of an empty project.json file
## * Moving to csproj again (less verbose)


---

# Roslyn 
## * Compiler as a service
## * Scripting engine
## * Open Source 
## * You use it every day to compile your .Net projects
## * Used to be a black box 

---

# OmniSharp
## Intellisense as a service 
## Can work with any IDE
## Works best with Visual Studio Code 


---

# Runners

## CS-Script/ScriptCS (Full framework)

## Dotnet-Script (.Net Core)

## CSI (Full framework. Shipped with Visual Studio)

---

---


# NuGet Packages



It all started here 

https://github.com/filipw/dotnet-script/issues/25



```c#
#r "nuget: AutoMapper, 6.2.0"
```

Runner : Dotnet-Script

Intellisense provided by OmniSharp.Roslyn

# Intellisense

## How hard can it be?



Q: [How long would it take me to roll my own intellisense](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9556026/a-new-and-full-implementation-of-generic-intellisense)?

A:

> "So let's say it should take you about ten to twenty years of full time work, working alone, to build a Roslyn-quality IntelliSense engine for C# that can do acceptably-close-to-correct analysis of large programs in the time between keystrokes.
>   Longer if you need to do that PhD first, obviously."

> Eric Lippert

---

# Debugging

## * Console.WriteLine (nah, we don't want that )

## * Visual Studio Code (Dotnet-Script)

## * Full Visual Studio (ScriptCS)

```
var match = RegEx.Match(myInput, "^M{0,4}(CM|CD|D?C{0,3})(XC|XL|L?X{0,3})(IX|IV|V?I{0,3})$");
if (match.IsMatch)
{
    Console.WriteLine(match.Groups[1].Value);
}        
```

---
# In a NutShell
## * No top level class
## * Cross platform
## * Top level extension methods.

---

# What's next 

## * Script Packages 
## * REPL 

---

# Open Source - Getting what you want 

## * Team up with people that can help you
## * These people know other people that you need to talk to.
## * Always be polite and listen to others
